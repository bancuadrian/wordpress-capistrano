<p>In the lifespan of an open source project, there are milestone moments. Even though only half of the REST API is in WordPress 4.4, I consider this to be one of those moments.</p>
<p>If all goes well, developers will have access to the complete REST API in WordPress 4.5. I hope you&#8217;ll join me in congratulating all of the contributors that have and continue to work on the REST API.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 08 Oct 2015 08:38:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>On July 22nd, Dion Hulse <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1770">committed a change</a> with little fanfare to the WordPress theme directory that allows registered users to mark themes as favorites.</p>

<p>Registered users who are logged into WordPress.org will see a heart icon above the download button on a theme&#8217;s detailed information page.

Many of the comments don&#8217;t link to or provide data that backs up their claim.</p>
<p>Outside of the <a href="http://wptavern.com/benchmarks-indicate-jetpack-doesnt-negatively-impact-site-loading-times">benchmarks</a> produced by the BruteProtect team late last year, there&#8217;s little evidence to support the claim that Jetpack negatively impacts a site&#8217;s performance. <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ideag/#content-plugins">Arūnas Liuiza</a>, a WordPress plugin developer, is working <a href="http://blog.arunas.co/project-measure-jetpack/">on a new project</a> that hopes to solve the mystery of whether or not Jetpack causes sites to load more slowly.</p>
<h2>Preparing the Testing Environment</h2>
<p>In the next few weeks, Liuiza and his students will scour the WordPress plugin directory to find plugins with comparable features to Jetpack&#8217;s modules. The team is going to set up three identical WordPress sites with default Lorem Ipsum content.</p>
<p>One site will act as the benchmark, another will run Jetpack, and the third will run plugins similar to Jetpack&#8217;s modules. Liuiza explains how his students will perform the benchmark process:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ll start the measuring, with different plugins/modules activated and deactivated. We’ll be doing 1-to-1 comparisons, as well as some combos. We are going to measure load times, as well as some stats reported by Query Monitor such as memory usage, database query count etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>Liuiza says benchmark results will be published in a series of posts on his blog and on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/">Advanced WordPress Facbook group</a>. Liuiza is asking for the community&#8217;s help to locate plugins that are feature-comparable to the modules in Jetpack.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also asking for advice on the testing methodology he and his students should use. There&#8217;s no timetable on when the results will be published as it&#8217;s considered a side project.</p>
<h2>Benchmark Frontend Modules Only</h2>
<p>Jetpack currently has 36 modules but some of them simply connect to services such as VaultPress or VideoPress. I think Liuiza and his team should concentrate on modules that potentially impact a site&#8217;s frontend performance as it doesn&#8217;t make sense to benchmark modules that are only for the backend.</p>

From <a href="http://wptavern.com/10up-sponsors-helen-hou-sandi-to-work-full-time-on-wordpress-core">sponsoring Helen Hou-Sandi</a> to work full-time on WordPress core, to <a href="http://wptavern.com/drew-jaynes-to-lead-wordpress-4-2">sponsoring Drew Jaynes</a> to lead the WordPress 4.2 development cycle. In a post published on the company&#8217;s blog, <a href="http://10up.com/blog/2015/commitments-open-web/">10up announced</a> it will continue to invest in WordPress and other open source projects it works with on a daily basis.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, 10up is sponsoring Jaynes to work on WordPress full-time. The company has also created a Platform Engineer position and although it&#8217;s not hiring to fill the role, the company has left the title open-ended as it continues to support and build web platforms such as <a href="http://10up.com/blog/2015/sponsoring-sanitize-css/">santize.css</a> and <a href="http://10up.com/blog/2014/varying-vagrant-vagrants-future/">Varying Vagrant Vagrants</a>.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring Scott Kingsley Clark to Work on the Fields API Project</h2>
<p>In a major show of support, 10up is sponsoring 100 hours of <a href="http://scottkclark.com/">Scott Kingsley Clark’s</a> company time to work on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/fields-api/">Fields API Project</a>. Announced in May, the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/05/27/metadata-api-project-reborn-the-new-fields-api-project/">Fields API Project</a> is an offshoot of the Metadata API project. The Fields API would allow developers to register fields and sections for WordPress objects. According to Clark, the goal is to initially cover the following WordPress objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customizer (retrofitting it beneath the existing Customizer API)</li>
<li>User profile screen</li>
<li>Post editor</li>
<li>Settings screens (retrofitting it beneath the existing Settings API)</li>
<li>And other areas in the future (Comment editor, Network Settings screens [see <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15691">#15691</a>], Media modals, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>10up believes that supporting the Fields API Project will help move it into a viable state to potentially be added to WordPress in the near-future, &#8220;As a company with a central mission of creating great publishing experiences, the user and developer experiences a fields API can improve are something we are particularly well-versed in,&#8221; Hou-Sandi said.</p>
<p>Hou-Sandi goes on to explain that the web is built on open technologies that are usually maintained by small groups of people who rely on donations.</p>
<blockquote><p>The balance between use and support of open source software leans heavily toward use, and that imbalance has become even more apparent. Even with increased awareness around the plight of projects integral to a safe web, initiatives like OpenSSL continue to operate on small donations and the volunteer efforts of a few. It takes time to convert pledges into action, and we’ve yet to see very many pledges at all, much less action.</p></blockquote>
<p>The following quote written by Jake Goldman, <a href="http://10up.com/about/#employee-jake-goldman">Founder and President of 10up</a>, explains why reinvesting in open source projects is so important not only for his company&#8217;s customers, but the WordPress userbase in general.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve said repeatedly that nothing is more critical to the success of agencies that rely on community, open source software platforms than the continued success of those platforms. It is incumbent upon those who have leveraged free, open platforms with success to share that success back.</p>
<p>By economically enabling world-class engineers to improve open platforms, we not only ensure that our customers continue to have a first class solution, we enable the next generation of builders, who can’t yet afford such resources, to further grow our ecosystem and the platform’s demand. I believe this is the social contract of open source, and as 10up grows, so to will our contributions to open source. It’s not just responsible citizenship, it’s good business.</p></blockquote>
<p>It makes sense for companies whose businesses rely on open source software to find ways to reinvest time, energy, and money back into those projects less they disappear. That&#8217;s precisely what 10up is doing along with <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/">a few other companies</a>. Let me know in the comments if and how your company is contributing back to open source software.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 06 Oct 2015 21:09:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>When the plugin directory <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-launches-new-design">launched a redesign</a> earlier this year, <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-launches-new-design">a common complaint</a> from readers is that the ability to see new plugins added to the directory was removed. Unlike the plugin browser in WordPress, the browser on WordPress.com displays new plugins.</p>
<p>Both browsers display similar information in the detailed view with the exception that the WordPress.com browser doesn&#8217;t show a list of contributors. Enej Bajgorić, a member of the Jetpack development team, explains how to quickly install a plugin to a Jetpack site when browsing the WordPress plugin directory:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you find yourself browsing the WordPress.org plugin repository and want to install the plugin on your Jetpack site, you can just replace the .org in the URL with .com and be taken to the new Plugin Browser where you can install the plugin with a single click. You will need to be logged into your WordPress.com account for this to work.</p></blockquote>
<p>A plugin browser to search for and install plugins is another feature that makes Jetpack Manage a free, decent alternative to commercial services for managing multiple sites. If you manage multiple sites with Jetpack Manage, let us know what you think and what key features you&#8217;d like to see added.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 06 Oct 2015 18:29:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Tom will be speaking at <a href="https://nyc.wordcamp.org/2015/">WordCamp New York</a> later this month on escaping and security.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is a story about my job as a <a href="http://vip.wordpress.com" target="_blank">VIP Wrangler</a>, what <a href="http://automattic.com" target="_blank">Automattic</a> does to keep Automatticians happy, and my battles with anxiety, <a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/adventures-in-depression.html" target="_blank">depression</a>, and fear.</p>
<h2>Joining the VIP Team</h2>
<p>Almost a year ago, I worked for <a href="http://codeforthepeople.com/">Code For The People</a>, a six person development agency that was in acquisition talks with Automattic. I remember at the beginning of the week, we thought an acquisition could happen before Christmas and by the following Friday, we were signing new employment contracts, and booking tickets to Lisbon for the VIP team meet up!</p>
<p>I remember being the first to arrive, surrounded by people from the VIP team I&#8217;ve never met in person. We went out for dinner, learned how to do deploys, visited aquariums, gardens, and then went home.</p>
<h2>The Happiness Rotation</h2>
<p>After the meet up, I spent two months finishing contracts and started my Happiness Rotation. A happiness rotation is three weeks of working on the WordPress.com support team to get in touch with the problems end users are facing. Every Automattician has to go through a happiness rotation as part of their trial.</p>
<p>Working the happiness rotation was hard. When I say this, I don&#8217;t mean it was an insurmountable task. I had a full-time Happiness Engineer available 24/7 to ask any question I wanted, a week of walkthroughs, supervised working, mountains of documentation, pre-written examples, and slack channels with friendly supportive people. I knew what to do, how to do it, and <a href="https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/736/tom-j-nowell" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve done it before</a>.</p>
<h2>VIP Training</h2>
<p>Despite this, I struggled, and VIP training began. Work at VIP fits into several sub roles that developers cycle through and training consists of a week in each role mentored by an experienced VIP Wrangler. Afterwards, we continue the cycle as full VIP Wranglers. Throughout the entire process, I had a general mentor for any and all things Automattic, be it mystery acronyms, or how to book a holiday.</p>
<p>At this point, I realized my job had grown in scope and felt insurmountable. I didn&#8217;t know what was going on and there was still much to learn. Combined with a torrent of new notifications, p2s, and emails, I felt lost. GitHub scaled from two to three emails per day to hundreds, P2 posts filled my other inbox, people asked difficult questions, and the sheer amount of activity at Automattic was overwhelming.</p>
<h2>Dealing With Adversity</h2>
<p>In the last few years, I viewed Automattic as my career end goal and suddenly I was there, years ahead of schedule. Not just that, I was struggling. I couldn&#8217;t grasp what was going on and I felt paralyzed in the face of work. I grappled with the thought that I was bad at my job, didn&#8217;t belong there, and that I wouldn&#8217;t last the next six months. I had this feeling that at any time, they were going to pull me into a call and say it isn&#8217;t working out.</p>
<p>A number of questions ran through my head. What would people think if they saw I left after the acquisition? Everyone&#8217;s treating it as a promotion and congratulating me. Maybe I&#8217;m not ready? I was handed a theme to review and struggling to read basic lines of code, mulling it over in my mind, why can&#8217;t I do this?</p>
<p>Sometimes I had the wrong window open and was reviewing my code but was so preoccupied, I didn&#8217;t realize it. Today, it takes me four days to review 6,000 lines of code in a theme but at the time, it took me two weeks to move through 1,000 lines.</p>
<h2>The Catch Up Calls</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s at this point that I was introduced to the bi-weekly catch up call. The team leads would chat with each person individually every two weeks to find out how they were, what they were doing, and what they&#8217;d like to do the following week. It was a chance to flag any problems and plan ahead.</p>
<p>I experienced nothing like this at CFTP or at any of my previous jobs and combined with the stalling work on the review, I panicked. My first catch up call was awkward and didn&#8217;t last long. My second catch up call didn&#8217;t go so well. I was at WordCamp Norway preparing to give a talk on <a href="http://www.wptherightway.org/en/index.html" target="_blank">WP The Right Way</a>. I sat in a quiet room and received a call on a Skype from my team lead.</p>
<p>I felt as though I was put on the spot having to justify what I&#8217;d been doing the last two weeks, and trying to figure out how to spin weeks of panicking in front of a computer into a tale of bountiful code reviewing, pleasant Norwegian winters, and a smile.</p>
<h2>Recovering From the Breakdown</h2>
<p>Instead, I closed my machine and burst into tears. A few minutes later I opened my machine, apologized, and tried to explain what had happened. I was told they didn&#8217;t care how much work I was doing as long as I was learning and happy. A colleague picked up the review I was working on and noted that I was  thorough with the parts I reviewed.</p>
<p>My team lead, Steph, checked up on me every two to three days for the next two weeks to make sure I was okay and tried to find what kind of work I took to best. I spent time on deploys, then moved on to a long rotation doing code review so that I could focus on particular tasks and build my confidence.</p>
<p>While this was happening, another colleague asked if I was okay as he thought I was down. He introduced me to an internal slack channel called <a href="http://bluehackers.org/" target="_blank">Bluehackers</a> where other Automatticians who struggled could share their experiences. Seeing other people talk candidly about their problems made me recognize a lot of things I hadn&#8217;t considered, the most important being that I wasn&#8217;t alone.</p>
<h2>I&#8217;m Not Alone</h2>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t the only one who struggled some days and failed to get anything done. I wasn&#8217;t the only one who panicked when faced with new or even familiar tasks. Everyone at VIP was friendly and supportive, not because they knew of my situation, but because they are nice people. One time, my technical lead sent me three family sized pies because we had a slack discussion on pudding.</p>
<p>Sometimes I don&#8217;t get anything done. Sometimes I struggle to do things I normally do effortlessly. Sometimes I turn off the video in calls because I&#8217;m still in bed. It&#8217;s 3PM and I can&#8217;t bring myself to get up, changed, and eat. There are so many projects I want to do. I have the knowledge, I have the resources, the support, the time, but they don&#8217;t get done, and it&#8217;s a struggle to explain why. Sometimes it&#8217;s things I know that need doing, like buying food or paying bills.</p>
<h2>Confirmation Things are Working Out</h2>
<p>A few months later I was in Seville at WordCamp Europe. Initially, I wasn&#8217;t going to go but decided I would regret it if I didn&#8217;t. I threw some clothes in a suitcase and purchased a flight. Large groups of people are scary, but I&#8217;ve found WordCamps tend to have familiar friendly faces mixed in. I can&#8217;t stress how big a boost it is to be able to see and make friends from event to event, yet still meet new people.</p>
<p>Before I left, I found myself with my former boss and now colleague. He asked how I was getting along at Automattic. He asked me this before, and I said, &#8220;It was rough at the start but I think I&#8217;m there now.&#8221; He told me that everyone else at the company thought good of me and that I was fitting in well. It might have been simple statement but it meant a lot to me.</p>
<h2>A Bout of Impostor Syndrome</h2>
<p>I had real moments when I went to sleep thinking I was going to lose my job, that I might not be cut out to be a developer, and that I didn&#8217;t deserve the things I had. But throughout the entire process, my team leads and my colleagues tried to support me. They placed my well-being first and they proactively asked if I was ok when they suspected something was wrong, and sought to put real solutions in place where they could.</p>
<p>They found other people with similar problems and tried to give me the ability to express what was happening, sharing their own problems coping, and what they were doing to keep on top of them. They gave praise and listened to good ideas, asked for help when they needed it, and they understood. Right now, I&#8217;m ok, but things have a habit of creeping up unnoticed, triggered by unexpected things.</p>
<p>I get anxious about food at WordCamps if I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s being served, I&#8217;m uncomfortable in social situations, and at times I have problems gathering the energy to do day-to-day things, but I&#8217;m lucky. I have a good job, a nice family, a comfortable apartment, and interesting work. My problems are mild and I know others have it worse. Most people are going to pretend everything&#8217;s ok but everyone needs a little help.</p>
<h2>Suggestions for Employers and Struggling Employees</h2>
<p>Automattic has things in place to make sure Automatticians lead healthy mental lives. We have an unlimited holiday allowance, a small expense budget to make traveling easier (e.g. a pot of tea at an airport or a massage), team meet ups, sabbaticals, and many others. Matt Mullenweg doesn&#8217;t want Automatticians to struggle, we work hard and it takes its toll. Often, we forget that we have to take care of our emotional and mental needs and give ourselves time.</p>
<p>Consider creating your own internal Bluehackers group and give people avenues to express themselves when they need to. Make sure they&#8217;re happy, and that you care about their well-being more than their quality of work and output as reassurance goes a long way. Some companies have gone as far as setting minimum holiday allowances to force employees to spend time on themselves.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re dealing with problems like these, talk about it. Talk to a GP/Doctor, a friend, family, whatever works for you. Talking is hard, but it&#8217;s necessary. If someone opens up to you, listen. Don&#8217;t try to offer solutions, don&#8217;t compare and contrast, don&#8217;t try to offer sympathy, don&#8217;t expect it to be sorted out in a month&#8217;s time. Simply listen as that person chose to tell you, so give them space and respect.</p>
<p>If you suspect someone is down, ask them if they&#8217;re ok and if you notice they bounce back, tell them, and tell them you&#8217;re glad! Highlight interesting things that happen, help them when they make a mistake, ask them when you make one yourself. But remember, sometimes all someone needs is a hug and a cup of tea to know that things are ok. Give them space, don&#8217;t ask for explanations, and let them know you&#8217;re there if you need them.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 05 Oct 2015 17:11:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Since launching in 2008, Hesketh&#8217;s videos have been viewed more than a million times by over 500k people. He&#8217;s also re-recorded the videos that make up the WP101 series 17 times. With seven years of experience under his belt, I asked Hesketh what he would have done differently in the beginning.</p>
<p>&#8220;From a technical standpoint, I wish I’d picked a solid membership plugin that would have enabled us to grow. We’re planning a costly migration in the coming months, and a better membership plugin might have saved us the considerable hassle and cost,&#8221; Hesketh told the Tavern.</p>
<p>Technical issues aside, Hesketh believes his business&#8217; success is largely due to his focus on serving people, &#8220;It’s one thing to create an online course and hope people discover it. But it takes much more dedication to actually engage people on a daily basis, take the time to understand their goals, and then help them get clear on how to accomplish those goals,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Hesketh doesn&#8217;t have any regrets but wishes he launched the question and answer forum on the first day, &#8220;Its given me the opportunity to answer questions that may not be covered in our videos. That’s the real value that WP101 brings to the table, real people helping others,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>WP101 launched around the same time as a lot of commercial theme shops such as iThemes, StudioPress, and WooThemes. Although WP101 doesn&#8217;t sell commercial themes or plugins, Hesketh has carved out a space in the WordPress ecosystem that enables him to make a living. If you use WP101 or have in the past, I&#8217;d love to hear what you think of his videos in the comments.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 03 Oct 2015 01:33:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

It&#8217;s the first time I met Mendel Kurland, Christopher Carfi, and Kurt Payne in person. During lunch, we discussed a number of topics from the efforts made to change the company&#8217;s image, to ideas that help the WordPress community.</p>
<p>I suggested to the team that GoDaddy create a billboard chart that shows the most popular themes and plugins used across its network. Not only would the information be beneficial to the company, it would also give the WordPress community valuable insight into what plugins and themes are used on a webhosting network with millions of customers.</p>
<p>Nine months after our discussion, GoDaddy turned the idea into reality with the <a href="https://garage.godaddy.com/wordpress-hot-100/">Hot 100</a>.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GoDaddyHot100.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48463" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GoDaddyHot100.png?resize=1025%2C682" alt="Top 100 Plugins and Themes of The Week" /></a>Top 100 Plugins and Themes of The Week
<p>GoDaddy tracks which themes and plugins are activated across the millions of sites it hosts and puts the 100 most popular of each into a list. The list is generated each week and places the previous week of results into an archive allowing you to monitor trends.</p>
<p>Similar to the <a href="http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100">Billboard Hot 100</a>, you can see the current rank of a plugin or theme, whether it&#8217;s moved up or down, and what its rank was the previous week. With an influential list like the Hot 100, it would be easy to accept paid listings. Carfi, confirms <a href="https://garage.godaddy.com/webpro/wordpress/hot-100-wordpress-plugins-and-themes/">it&#8217;s not possible</a> to purchase placement.</p>
<h2>How the Lists Are Generated</h2>
<p>The Hot 100 is determined by ranking the net change in the number of active installs of WordPress plugins and themes in aggregate across GoDaddy&#8217;s hosting network. It looks at plugins and themes that are active at the time of the analysis and does not include plugins or themes that are deactivated.</p>
<p>Instead of using the total number of active installs, the Hot 100 looks at the week-over-week change in active installs. This enables the list to determine which plugins and themes are hot or part of a rising trend. It also prevents bias towards plugins that already have a large install base such as Jetpack.</p>
<p>Interestingly, themes on the list that are non-GPL are specifically noted and link to the Hot 100 instead of their corresponding theme page. In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1025849944143886/">post published</a> to the Advanced WordPress Facebook group, Jeff King, Senior Vice President of Hosting at GoDaddy explains why.</p>
<blockquote><p>One great recommendation and valuable bit of feedback we received is that, since the community embraces GPL, we should reflect that ethos in the Hot 100 list. While some non-GPL themes or plugins may occasionally show up in the list due to the fact that some non-GPL items still exist in the ecosystem, we don&#8217;t necessarily need to link to them. As of next week, we&#8217;ll be removing links to non-GPL themes and plugins.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Hot 100 Is a Valuable Resource</h2>
<p>Although WordPress.org provides stats for plugin and theme authors, you can&#8217;t determine where they&#8217;re being used. The GoDaddy Hot 100 gives the public and developers of popular plugins and themes an opportunity to see how well they&#8217;re doing on one of the largest webhosts in the industry. While Jetpack and Akismet are the two most active plugins and seven default themes make up the top 10 themes, it&#8217;s the 25th-100th rankings that I find interesting.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/">Hello Dolly</a> which ships with WordPress and is activated by default after installation is ranked 27th this week. Last week, it ranked 38th meaning a lot of new installs of WordPress have taken place. This indicates that even though a lot of customers disable the plugin at some point after installation, it remains active on many sites hosted by GoDaddy.</p>
<p>One of the largest jumps I&#8217;ve seen so far is the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/image-widget/">Image Widget</a> plugin by Modern Tribe. It was ranked 95th last week and 31st this week. It would be interesting to know why a lot of new WordPress installs are activating this plugin on GoDaddy hosted sites this week versus last week.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://garage.godaddy.com/wordpress-hot-100/">Hot 100</a> is a valuable resource and I encourage you to see if your favorite plugins and themes made the list. Although it&#8217;s specific to GoDaddy, do you think the data is valuable? Would you like to see other large webhosting companies provide a glimpse into the most active WordPress themes and plugins used across their network?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 02 Oct 2015 18:51:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

In this post, I highlight six plugins that solve a problem I encountered or enhance comments for both readers and site administrators. All of the plugins are free of charge and available from the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">WordPress plugin directory</a>.</p>
<h2>Problem Solvers</h2>
<h3>Crowd Control</h3>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlPluginBanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48420" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlPluginBanner.png?resize=799%2C253" alt="Crowd Control Plugin Banner" /></a>I discovered that not all comments need to be moderated. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/crowd-control/">Crowd Control</a>, by Postmatic, gives readers the ability to report comments they feel don&#8217;t adhere to a site&#8217;s commenting policy.</p>
<p>When enabled, a new option is displayed on the <strong>General &#8211; Discussion</strong> settings page. You can configure how many reports a comment needs before it&#8217;s sent to the moderation queue and whether administrators should be notified when it happens.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlSettings.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48421" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlSettings.png?resize=798%2C174" alt="Crowd Control Settings" /></a>Crowd Control Settings
<p>If an administrator approves a comment that&#8217;s in moderation due to hitting the threshold, it won&#8217;t end up back in the moderation queue. This gives administrators the last word on whether a comment is acceptable or not.</p>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlInAction.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48422" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlInAction.png?resize=686%2C202" alt="Crowd Control in Action" /></a>Crowd Control in Action
<p>If you think a comment needs an administrator&#8217;s attention or does not adhere to the WP Tavern <a href="http://wptavern.com/comment-policy">commenting policy</a>, hover over the comment and click the report button. A new column is added to <strong>edit-comments.php</strong> that displays how many reports a comment has. It&#8217;s important to note that detailed information of who reported the comment is not saved to the database.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlReportedColumn.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48423" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlReportedColumn.png?resize=807%2C193" alt="Reported Comments Column" /></a>Reported Comments Column
<p>The system is open for abuse but I trust that the Tavern readership will use it responsibly.</p>
<h3>Show Parent Comment</h3>
<p>Comments that are pending moderation in the WordPress backend that are in response to another comment are hard to moderate. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/">Show Parent Comment</a>, developed by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/stephencronin/">Stephen Cronin</a>, adds a <strong>Show More</strong> dropdown to the <strong>edit-comments.php</strong> screen that allows administrators to see the text of the comment that a person is responding too.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/6-wordpress-plugins-that-take-native-comments-to-the-next-level#gallery-48414-1-slideshow">Click to view slideshow.</a><br />
I&#8217;ve used this plugin for more than two weeks and I enjoy the user interface. It looks and acts as if it&#8217;s a natural part of WordPress. Chris Christoff <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33627">created a ticket</a> in Trac with the suggestion that a user interface element like the one in Cronin&#8217;s plugin be added to core. If you have feedback on the best way to accomplish this, please add it to the ticket.</p>
<h2>Enhancements to Native Comments</h2>
<h3>Epoch</h3>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EpochPluginBanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48415" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EpochPluginBanner.png?resize=806%2C255" alt="Epoch Plugin Banner" /></a><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/epoch/">Epoch</a> is a plugin developed by Postmatic and a few other contributors that enhances WordPress&#8217; comment system. Unlike services such as Disqus or Livefyre that replace the comment system, Epoch adds features to WordPress&#8217; native comments. This allows you to keep comments within your database at all times without relying on a third-party.</p>
<p>Epoch applies a series of visual enhancements to the comment form. Replies from the post author are a different color from regular responses and the date and time the comment is written is displayed at the top. Epoch also uses Ajax to send and receive comments which eliminates the need to refresh the page.</p>
<a href="http://wptavern.com/6-wordpress-plugins-that-take-native-comments-to-the-next-level#gallery-48414-2-slideshow">Click to view slideshow.</a>
<p>Epoch has a front end moderation capability that allows site administrators to approve, trash, or spam comments. Unlike the native comment form, Epoch doesn&#8217;t load the comments unless the browser reaches a certain point on a post or is accessed via a direct link.</p>
<p>In most instances, the comment form loads quickly but on certain mobile devices, the lack of speed is noticeable. The team is aware of the performance issues and is attacking the problem with a three stage approach.</p>
<p>Epoch relies on JavaScript to function so if a visitor browsing your site has JavaScript disabled, the comments don&#8217;t load. Again, the team is aware of this issue and is creating a fallback to WordPress&#8217; native comment system if the files can&#8217;t be retrieved from its CDN or JavaScript is disabled.</p>
<h3>Basic Comment Quicktags</h3>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BasicCommentQuicktagPluginBanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48426" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BasicCommentQuicktagPluginBanner.png?resize=769%2C251" alt="Basic Comment Quicktag Plugin Banner" /></a>In WordPress 4.3, the allowed HTML tags text displayed near the comment form <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30157">was removed</a>. The tags were removed because they&#8217;re note relevant and confusing to most users. While I agree that the text is not relevant, I think the comment form should have basic text formatting buttons so readers don&#8217;t have to remember and manually type HTML tags.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BasicCommentQuicktagsOnTheTavern.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48428" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BasicCommentQuicktagsOnTheTavern.png?resize=665%2C368" alt="Basic Comment Quicktags in Action" /></a>Basic Comment Quicktags in Action
<p>Once Basic Comment Quicktags is installed, navigate to <strong>Settings &#8211; Discussion</strong> and check the box to enable them for comments. When enabled, the comment text area will have Bold, Italic, Link and Quote buttons. The best part of this plugin is that it exposes a built-in core feature using the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Quicktags_API">Quicktags API</a> added to WordPress 3.3. Text formatting buttons in the comment area is a courtesy I&#8217;d like more site owners to give to readers.</p>
<h3>Simple Comment Editing</h3>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SimpleCommentEditingPluginBanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48429" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SimpleCommentEditingPluginBanner.png?resize=764%2C262" alt="Simple Comment Editing Plugin Banner" /></a><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-comment-editing/">Simple Comment Editing</a>, developed by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ronalfy/">Ronald Huereca</a>, adds the ability for readers to edit their comments in a limited time frame. By default, readers have five minutes to edit their comment once it&#8217;s submitted. Although no configuration is necessary, you can alter the time and behavior of the plugin by using <a href="https://github.com/ronalfy/simple-comment-editing#wordpress-filters">actions and filters</a>. I&#8217;ve changed the time limit to 15 minutes on the Tavern to make sure readers have plenty of time to make edits.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SimpleCommentEditingInAction.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48430" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SimpleCommentEditingInAction.png?resize=676%2C173" alt="Simple Comment Editing Countdown Timer" /></a>Simple Comment Editing Countdown Timer
<p>With Simple Comment Editing installed, the amount of contact form submissions and requests to edit a comment have gone down considerably.</p>
<h3>Postmatic</h3>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PostmaticPluginBanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48432" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PostmaticPluginBanner.png?resize=801%2C235" alt="Postmatic Plugin Banner" /></a><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/postmatic/">Postmatic</a> is a plugin that <a href="https://gopostmatic.com/">ties into a service</a> and has a number of features. Readers can subscribe to posts or to comments and receive updates via email. Postmatic has a beautiful email template that shows the most recent reply, the commenter&#8217;s Gravatar, and a recap of the post and conversation.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PostmaticCommentEmailTemplate.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48433" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PostmaticCommentEmailTemplate.png?resize=727%2C833" alt="Postmatic Comment Email Template" /></a>Postmatic Comment Email Template
<p>Readers can respond to comments via email without having to visit the comment form. Site administrators can reply, trash, or submit comments to Akismet via email. It&#8217;s important to note that Postmatic is not a third-party commenting service. Instead, it uses the native comment system in WordPress allowing you to keep and own your data at all times.</p>
<p>While I moderate comments from the WordPress mobile app or the WordPress backend, Postmatic is a great fallback. I also think the email template looks great and offers a better user experience than the comment notification emails provided by WordPress. Postmatic <a href="https://gopostmatic.com/technology/">does a lot more</a> than what I describe above but for the purpose of this article, I focused on the comment portion of the service.</p>
<p>Postmatic is a new addition to the Tavern that I encourage you to try. After trying it out, please tell me about your experience. I especially wany to know if it&#8217;s easier to keep track of and take part in conversations.</p>
<h2 class="font-headlines">Notifications That a Comment in Moderation is Approved</h2>
<p>One of the problems I&#8217;ve yet to solve is being addressed by a number of WordPress contributors in <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717#comment:6">ticket 33717</a>. If all goes well, it&#8217;s possible this feature will be added to WordPress 4.4. Once added, readers whose comments end up in the moderation queue will automatically be notified by WordPress when it&#8217;s approved.</p>
<h2>It’s Not Perfect but It&#8217;s an Improvement</h2>
<p>Even with all the features these plugins provide, I don&#8217;t think the comment system in WordPress or the form on WP Tavern is perfect. I&#8217;m not sure if perfection of either can be achieved. However, I think both are improvements over the previous iterations. If there&#8217;s a plugin you use to improve WordPress&#8217; native comments or its moderation system, let me know about it in the comments.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 01 Oct 2015 08:28:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>I&#8217;m sorry I never met Alex, however I remember working virtually with him and Adam Tow on AllThingsD which seems like a lifetime away now. Adam has <a href="http://tow.com/2015/09/28/remembering-alex-king/">a great article</a> on Alex on his blog, as does Matt <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/09/remembering-alex-king/">who went into detail</a> about Alex&#8217;s involvement with WordPress going back to the days of b2. I had completely forgotten <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/25/wordpress-css-style-competition">the CSS competition</a> he mentioned!</p>

In the ticket, Scribu explains that the View Post button is redundant functionality and suggests that it be removed in favor of a clickable permalink.</p>
<p>Here are two screenshots of the post editor. The first is WordPress 4.3 and the second is WordPress 4.4. Clicking the permalink allows you to preview the post in its current state. Notice the slug part of the URL is in bold. You need to click the Edit button to edit the permalink.</p>

<p>Not only does this change remove redundant functionality, it removes a UI element from the page. Enhancements like these are a huge win for WordPress because it makes the interface simpler without permanently removing the button&#8217;s purpose.</p>
<p>In addition to the View Post button, the Get Shortlink button is also removed. The button shows up if you’re using a custom shortlink and can be re-enabled using code or a plugin. For most users, the Edit button is the only one they&#8217;ll see between the post title and content box.</p>
<p>I expect some users will be frustrated as they go through the process of changing their workflow but overall, I think it&#8217;s a great improvement. What do you think?</p>

Alex actually <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2002/10/24/b2-coding">got involved with b2 in 2002</a> and was active in the forums and the &#8220;hacks&#8221; community there.</p>
<p>Alex had a background as a designer before he learned development, and I think that really came through as he was one of those rare people who thought about the design and usability of his code, the opposite of most development that drifts toward entropy and complexity. One of my favorite things about Alex was how <em>darn tasteful</em> he was. He would think about every aspect of something he built, every place someone could click, every path they could go down, and gave a thoughtfulness to these paths that I still admire and envy today.</p>
<p>As an example look&nbsp;at his <a href="http://alexking.org/project/post-formats-admin-ui">project page (essentially a category archive) for the Post Formats Admin UI</a>, isn&#8217;t that clever and intuitive how the posts connect together, and when more time passes in the thread it&#8217;s <a href="https://cloudup.com/ceWJeb9zcK6">shown as a break</a>. It&#8217;s classic Alex: something simple and thoughtful that in hindsight is so gobsmackingly obvious you wonder why everything doesn&#8217;t work that way, but you never would have imagined it beforehand. And Alex wouldn&#8217;t just imagine it and do it for himself, he released his best work as open source, as a gift to the community and the world, over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Back when WordPress was getting started Alex was a celebrity of the b2 world, his hacks (plugins before plugins) were&nbsp;some of the coolest ones around. We had a ton of overlapping interests in web standards, photography, development, and gadgets so&nbsp;we frequently read and commented on each other&#8217;s blogs. I would never miss a post on his site, and that&#8217;s back when we were both doing one or more posts a day. To get a sense of Alex it&#8217;s worth <a href="http://alexking.org/blog">exploring his blog</a> &#8212; he was a clear thinker and therefore a clear writer.&nbsp;The straightforward nature Alex wrote with was something I always admired about him.</p>
<p>We <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2003/07/08/wordpress-development">discussed WordPress early on</a>, Alex <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2003/07/23/wordpress-hacks">signed up to help with what later became the plugin directory</a>, and <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/25/wordpress-css-style-competition">his CSS competition</a> (look at those prizes! and notice it&#8217;s all GPL) was hugely influential on the path to themes, and <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2003/08/15/wordpress-dev">he officially became a contributing developer in August of 2003</a>.</p>
<p>The list of what Alex was one of the first to do in the WordPress community is long, and <em>in hindsight</em> seems gobsmackingly obvious, which is the sign of innovation. I smile when I think of how he <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2003/10/02/moving-to-denver">moved from the Bay area to Denver</a> before it was cool, or his <a href="https://cloudup.com/cL9v2RKEI0T">love of scare quotes</a>. Once there was something going on in WordPress and he called me to talk about it, I was so surprised, he said the number was right on my contact page (and it was) but even though it had been there for years no one had ever called it before, but that was just the type of person Alex was, always reaching out and connecting.</p>

<p><em>Adam Tow, myself, Barry Abrahamson, Alex King; Photo from <a href="http://tow.com/2015/09/28/remembering-alex-king/">Adam Tow&#8217;s post</a>.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how to include this next part: I couldn&#8217;t write last night &#8212; I was too tired. After falling&nbsp;asleep I had one of those super vivid dreams that you can&#8217;t tell are dreams. There had been some sort of mix-up on Twitter and Alex was still alive, I&nbsp;visited Colorado with my sister and saw him surrounded by family at a picnic table, all the rooms were taken so they put me on a floor mattress where I slept. Tons of his friends were around and we took pictures together, he was excited about the better front&nbsp;camera on the 6s+. (Alex understood&nbsp;mobile all the way back to the Treo days.) It was all very ordinary and in a group setting, until we decided to walk alongside a small highway, past some grain silos, to meet the group at a bar. The walk was just the two of us and we talked and&nbsp;laughed about the big mix-up and he asked about this post, what was going to be in it. He got most excited and emphatic with the part about him being a developer with great taste, and a clear writer <a href="http://www.williamzinsserwriter.com/">William Zinsser</a> would be proud of, so I like to think that those were two things he was proud of. The overwhelming emotion I remember was joy. Waking up was disconcerting, part of me wants to believe part of Alex&#8217;s spirit was there, where another more logical part thinks my mind was&nbsp;just going through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model">the denial stage of grief</a>. Regardless I know that Alex will stay in the minds of people who knew him for many years to come.</p>
<p>Code that Alex wrote still runs billions of times a day across millions of websites, and long after that code evolves or gets refactored the ideas and philosophy he embedded in WordPress will continue to be part of who we are. Alex believed so deeply in open source, and was one of the few people from a design background who did. (Every time you see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_icon">the share icon</a> on the web or in Android you should think of him.) I like the idea that part of his work will&nbsp;continue in software for decades to come, but I&#8217;d rather have him here, thinking outside the box and challenging us to do better, to be more obvious, and work harder for our users. He never gave up.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 29 Sep 2015 17:57:43 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Alex King, who founded web development agency <a href="https://crowdfavorite.com/">Crowd Favorite,</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/alexkingorg/">author</a> of several WordPress themes and plugins <a href="http://tow.com/2015/09/28/remembering-alex-king/">passed away last night</a> at his home. In January 2013, King was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer. He used his blog to tell the <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer">story of his fight to stay alive</a>.</p>
<p>On August 24th, King <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/cycle-1-of-new-trial">finished the first cycle</a> of a new clinical trial that he says went well.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m nearly through my first cycle of the new clinical trial and overall I think it’s gone pretty well. I was able to get the 6 pills/day (3 in the morning, 3 in the evening) without too much concern. That said, by the end of the 5 days taking the pills I would basically sleep for the day.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the same day, he published what would be his <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/rememberances">final request</a> to the WordPress community. King requested that anyone with memories of him and his career to submit them to his wife.</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the things my wife and I are trying to do is put together some information about my career that will hopefully give my 6 year-old daughter a better sense of who I was as an adult. She knows me as “dad”, but when she gets older she’ll be curious about who I was to my peers and colleagues.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you have any memories of King, please honor his request and <a href="http://alexking.org/contact">submit them</a> to his wife.</p>

<h2>King&#8217;s Impact on WordPress Early On</h2>
<p>King is one of a handful of people who witnessed the transition <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/master/Content/Part%201/2-b2-cafelog.md">from b2 to WordPress</a>. He&#8217;s one of the earliest WordPress developers and is largely credited with motivating developers to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/master/Content/Part%203/12-themes.md">build themes</a> using the template engine in WordPress 1.5.</p>
<blockquote><p>Alex King wrote a <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/20/wordpress-css-style-switcher">CSS Style Switcher</a> hack, which came with three CSS stylesheets. Not everyone who had a WordPress blog wanted to create their own stylesheet, and many didn’t know how. Users needed a pool of stylesheets to choose from. To grow the number of stylesheets available, Alex ran a WordPress <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/25/wordpress-css-style-competition">CSS Style competition</a>. Prizes, donated by members of the community, were offered for the top three stylesheets; $70, $35, and $10 respectively. &#8211; WordPress History Book</p></blockquote>
<p>In the first contest, King received 38 submissions with Pink Lillies by Naoko Takano winning first place.</p>

<p>Each sylesheet submitted to the contest was <a href="http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/styles">available to the public</a>. In essence, King&#8217;s website was an early version of the WordPress theme directory. In the <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2005/02/27/wordpress-theme-competition">second contest</a>, he received over 100 submissions. In total, King hosted 138 themes on his site. He decided not to host the competition again in 2006 due to the sheer amount of work required.</p>
<h2>Appearances</h2>
<p>King appeared on several different WordPress podcasts and spoke at a number of WordCamps. Here are links to a few of them.</p>

<h2>My Memorable Experience With Alex King</h2>
<p>The last time I spoke to King in person was at WordCamp San Francisco 2013. A group of us rode together in a party limo complete with blinking lights inside. I sat across from him and asked a few questions related to his health. I also asked him about the early days of WordPress. King was a soft-spoken man who at times is hard to hear but it turned out to be a great and memorable conversation.</p>

<p>He was one of a very small group of people involved during the transition of b2 to WordPress. He helped to create the website that would become the first WordPress.com VIP client. He started the first WordPress-centric consulting agency. He was fundamental to the development and direction of dozens of WordPress features. He even created a small icon that would go on to become the ubiquitous &#8220;share icon&#8221;.</p>
<p>Alex was a selfless contributor, a driven entrepreneur, and a friend to many. He was also a husband to Heather and a father to Caitlin.</p>
<p>In addition to web work, Alex loved golf and photography. His blog is an outstanding example of the art, where he logged his story, his passions, and his challenges. I could not possibly tell his story better <a href="http://alexking.org/about">than he himself can</a>.</p>

<p>According to Aaron Jorbin, WordPress core developer, the change improves navigation when using the keyboard to toggle through fields. It also makes it easier for users to leave comments.</p>
<p>Since the change requires filters and actions to run in a different order, the HTML output by <code>comment_form</code> will be different. Jorbin explains that if developers use any of the hooks inside <code>comment_form</code>, especially <code>comment_form_field_comment</code> and <code>comment_form_after_fields</code>, developers should test their themes and plugins using <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/nightly/">WordPress 4.4 nightlies</a>.</p>

<p>There was also concern that without being officially sanctioned by WordCamp Central, the event would infringe the <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/">WordCamp trademark</a> that is owned and protected by the WordPress Foundation. To alleviate these concerns, the organizing group changed the name from WordCampus to <a href="http://wpcampus.org/">WPCampus</a>.</p>
<p>Rachel Carden, one of the event&#8217;s primary organizers, says the team had a backup plan from day one, &#8220;While most of the community agreed that the name WordCampus was spot on, the possibility of changing our name was proposed from day one as WordCampus was being confused with WordCamp US,&#8221; Carden said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As much as we love WordCampus, we didn’t want it to get in the way of what we hope to achieve, so the topic was passionately discussed at a planning meeting. The entire community cast their votes for a new name and WPCampus was selected as the clear winner,&#8221; Carden told the Tavern.</p>

It will help your site run faster and serve more traffic.</p>
<p>This is a security and bugfix release.
<ul>
<li>Some servers display a directory index when no index.html is found in a directory. That may reveal the filenames of cache files.</li>
<li> There were issues in the settings page that might allow an attacker to browse or delete files named index.html.</li>
<li> PHP Object Injection could occur if an attacker managed to inject malicious code into the legacy cache meta files.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you upgrade, your “legacy cache” files for logged in users will be deleted. This may have an impact on your site:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your site is slow at generating new pages.</li>
<li>If you have many known users (logged in users or people who comment).</li>
</ul>
<p>Your site will suddenly have to generate new cache files for all visiting known users.</p>
<p>Relying on caching like this is not recommended for these types of users as it’s very inefficient. Each user has a separate cache file that must be checked whenever the plugin does administration work like cleaning up stale cache files.</p>
<p>If most of your traffic is anonymous users who don’t comment you don’t need to worry about this.</p>
<h3>Directory Listings</h3>
<p>If a server is configured to show directory listings it will show files and directories in the cache directory to visitors who access those directories directly through their browser. This might reveal private posts, and in the case where legacy caching is enabled for known users the login cookie was stored in &#8220;.meta&#8221; files that could be downloaded.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-11-at-14.40.00.png"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-11-at-14.40.00.png?resize=660%2C275" alt="2013" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-89499673" /></a></p>
<p>Files named &#8220;index.html&#8221; were added to the main cache directories to stop remote users viewing the contents of the cache directories. Unfortunately it&#8217;s not possible to add empty index.html files to the supercache directories because those files could be served by accident to legitimate visitors of the site. However, the plugin will also add a directive that disables directory listings to the file cache/.htaccess. You can now also change the location of the cache directory on the Advanced Settings page of the plugin. If you can&#8217;t disable directory indexing on your server and you have private posts you should change this location and use PHP mode to serve cache files.</p>
<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/cache-location.png?resize=660%2C314" alt="cache-location" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89499679" /></p>
<p>If a directory index is found in the cache directory it will show a warning like this to administrators:</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-12.27.29.png"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-12.27.29.png?resize=660%2C231" alt="index.html warnings" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-89499671" /></a></p>
<p>Clicking the logout link will log everyone out, except the user who clicks it, but it guarantees that the login cookies are updated, just in case someone has copied the cookie from an old meta file. </p>
<h3>Directory Traversal and File Deletion</h3>
<p>User input in the settings page wasn&#8217;t properly sanitised. The code that sanitised directory paths when deleting cache files wasn&#8217;t secure and might allow an attacker to view or delete files named index.html. Deletes are protected by a nonce, limiting the useful lifetime of the URL however.</p>
<h3>PHP Object Injection</h3>
<p>The plugin used serialize and unserialize <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/php-object-injection?replies=2">to store data</a> in &#8220;legacy cache&#8221; meta files. This might be used to perform a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Object_Injection">PHP object injection</a> attack. Serialised data is now stored as JSON data.</p>
<p>The format of legacy cached files has changed. The files in the meta directory no longer have a .meta extension. They are .php files now and each file has a &#8220;die()&#8221; command to stop anyone loading them.<br />
The data stored in those files is now stored as JSON serialised data. The login cookie is an MD5 hash now as well.<br />
When you upgrade the plugin your existing legacy cache files will be deleted and regenerated as visitors use your site.</p>
<p>Apart from those security fixes there have been a number of enhancements and bugfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li> Disabling the plugin no longer deletes the configuration file. Uninstalling will do that however.</li>
<li> Enhancement: Only preload public post types. Props webaware.</li>
<li> It&#8217;s now possible to deactivate the plugin without visiting the settings page.</li>
<li> Fixed the cache rebuild system. Rebuild files were deleted immediately but now survive up to 10 seconds longer than the request that generate them.</li>
<li> Minor optimisations: prune_super_cache() exits immediately if the file doesn&#8217;t exist.</li>
<li> The output of wp_cache_get_cookies_values() is now cached per visit.</li>
<li> Added PHP pid to the debug log to aid debugging.</li>
<li> Various small bug fixes.</li>
<li> Fixed reset of expiry time and GC settings when updating advanced settings.</li>
<li> Removed CacheMeta class to avoid APC errors. It&#8217;s not used any more.</li>
<li> Fixed reset of advanced settings when using &#8220;easy&#8221; settings page.</li>
</ul>

Not only was it an experiment to see what would happen but a new way for me to use WordPress. The experiment introduced me to several drawbacks in WordPress&#8217; comment moderation system.</p>
<h2>Lack of Context</h2>
<p>Comments that are pending moderation in the WordPress backend that are in response to another comment are hard to moderate. Take the following screenshot for example. This comment is in response to a comment submitted by Norcross. Unless I open Norcross&#8217; comment in a new browser tab or window, I have no idea what the context of the conversation is. Pending notifications in the WordPress mobile app also don&#8217;t show text from the parent comment.</p>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48150" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png?resize=851%2C161" alt="WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area" /></a>WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area
<p>I propose that WordPress core adds the text from parent comments to replies in the backend so I know what people are responding too. This also helps when replying to comments from the backend as I&#8217;ll know the context of the conversation.</p>
<h2>Lack of Notifications That a Comment in Moderation is Approved</h2>
<p>WordPress does not send an email notification when a comment is approved from moderation. However, there are a lot of people <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717">working to add</a> this feature to WordPress 4.4.</p>
<h2>A Whitelisting System for Anonymous Comments</h2>
<p>The biggest drawback to comment moderation is that not every comment needs to be moderated. A whitelisting system can lessen the burden of having to moderate each comment.</p>
<p>WordPress provides the ability to blacklist comments. You can also configure a set of parameters to determine when a comment goes into the moderation queue such as, number of links, content within the comment, and if the comment author has a previously approved comment. None of these configurations are useful if WordPress is configured to send every comment to moderation.</p>
<p>WP Tavern does not have open registration and allows comments from anonymous people. This makes whitelisting difficult since the IP address, name, URL, and email address of a commenter can easily change or be imitated. The whitelisting component of WordPress becomes more useful if you can tie it to a registered user account.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m unsure if WordPress can improve this area of the moderation system or if it&#8217;s an assumed risk administrators take when accepting anonymous comments.</p>
<h2>A Major Time Suck</h2>
<p>Moderating every comment is a pain and sucks up time that can be spent doing something else. During my vacation last week, I continued to moderate comments from the WordPress mobile app because if I didn&#8217;t, the conversation stopped. I&#8217;ve concluded that by accepting anonymous comments, there needs to be a way for the audience to help moderate instead of doing it on my own.</p>
<p>In a future post, I&#8217;m going to list a few WordPress plugins I&#8217;ve discovered that takes the commenting system to the next level. Many of the plugins solve one or most of the problems listed above.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 15:52:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>This week, Joe and Brian go into depth discussing all aspects of the WordPress REST API, and the state of the API today.</p>
<p>With the recent merge proposal, there is a good chance it will be included in WordPress core via a two stage process in the WordPress 4.4 and 4.5 releases. The first release would be the core infrastructure and the second release would include the endpoints. This is our longest podcast, but we go in depth on one of WordPress&#8217;s most anticipated features in years.</p>

<p>If a site enables comments for posts only, this location for the menu item makes sense. What if you&#8217;re using Custom Post Types? According the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/faq/">plugin&#8217;s FAQ</a>, the user experience might be weird, &#8220;If you have a post type other than <em>post</em> that supports comments, it may make more sense to not use this plugin,&#8221; Jacoby said.

In the session, Mullenweg answers questions like what advice he&#8217;d give to his 20 and 25-year-old self and how he combats burn out. Here are a few highlights from the session.<br />
</span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Nikhil V</strong> &#8211; Hello Matt, with the upcoming release of the WP REST API in WordPress core, what do you hope to most see built with its capabilities?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m hugely excited about the REST API! Once the infrastructure is in, I think we&#8217;ll see really widespread adoption from plugins that right now are creating their endpoints in very ad-hoc ways. Once we iterate a bit more on the core content endpoints and authentication I think we&#8217;ll see a lot more specialized interfaces built on WP as like a content kernel, an engine powering a wide array of applications and interfaces you&#8217;d never imagine having WordPress behind them today.</p>
<p><strong>Erik Torenberg &#8211; </strong>If you could go back in time and give advice for your, say, 20-year-old self, what would you tell yourself? How about 25?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg</strong> &#8211; To my 20-year-old self I would say to be okay with things building up over time. Something I didn&#8217;t appreciate until recently is that there any many productive decades ahead with which to build the things that I feel need to exist in the world. One of the best things I did then was avoid any press or capitalization on my age (to the extent I could) because youth is an ephemeral asset and just a novelty in business.</p>
<p>To my 25-year-old self I would tell him to slow down and think about health more, I burned the candle at both ends that year. I would also say to not get as caught up in mailing list and IRC arguments and discussions, just focus on building.</p>
<p><strong>Sydney Liu</strong> &#8211; In the early days of WordPress, what was the 20% that got you the 80% of the results?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg</strong> &#8211; There&#8217;s no simple answer there, if I had to pick one thing it would be <em>luck</em>.</p>
<p><strong> <span class="comments--item--heading--name">Kristof Bernaert</span></strong> &#8211; How do you see WP about 5 years, or how do you want it to see?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg</strong> &#8211; In 5 years I think that WP will be infinitely easier to use for both power-users, developers, and newbies. You will be able to have a full experience of core, plugins, themes, docs, and support in several dozen languages that will be as large or larger than English. There will be over a million people making their living on top of the platform. Most people will be creating from touch devices, and their content will mostly not come from keyboards (virtual or physical) as an input device.</p>
<p><strong><span class="comments--item--heading--name">Tys Bradford</span></strong> <span class="comments--item--heading--name">&#8211; Your accomplishments with WordPress have literally changed the face of the internet and enabled people without programming skills to make beautiful and functional websites. Do you think this could be replicated ever with mobile applications (iOS/Android)? I have seen a few companies try, but none have come close to delivering in the way WordPress is able to.</span></p>
<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg</strong> &#8211; Thank you! The ecosystems and app stores for iOS and Android right now are too locked down, and the discoverability and overhead of apps is too distorted, for an approach like WordPress&#8217; to work for mobile applications. The environment for the foreseeable future there is going to favor more centralized apps, my only hope is that at least a few get really successful (including ours) that aren&#8217;t advertising-driven.</p>
<h2>My Question Was Not Answered</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, my question was not answered. However, I&#8217;m going to ask it in this post with the hope that he&#8217;ll answer it in the comments.</p>
<p><em>You&#8217;ve spent a lot of time, money, and energy trying to create a great mobile experience in WordPress via dedicated apps. As more of the WordPress backend becomes responsive, how will this affect (if any) the priority level of developing the mobile apps versus putting that time and effort into a 100% responsive WordPress backend?</em></p>
<p>Mullenweg answers a lot more questions than what&#8217;s listed above but those are the ones that stand out to me.

Ryan McCue, a lead contributor to the project, published the first <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/">official proposal</a> to merge the API into WordPress. The proposal explains what the REST API is, why it&#8217;s needed, an integration plan, and what happens after the merge. The plan is to integrate the API in two stages, infrastructure and endpoints.</p>
<h2>Two Part Plan</h2>
<p>The infrastructure is the code responsible for routing requests and handling the meta layer of the API, including JSON serialization/deserialization, linking, embedding, and REST best practices. Merging the infrastructure first allows developers to start building upon it and to migrate from existing custom code. The plan is to merge the infrastructure portion of the API in WordPress 4.4.</p>
<p>Endpoints are considered the more complex of the two as they’re responsible for mapping data from the external JSON format to the internal data structures and vice versa. In other words, endpoints are the bridges of communication between WordPress and external applications. To provide more time for core committers to review the code, endpoints will be merged in WordPress 4.5.</p>
<p>Development of the API <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API">takes place on GitHub</a> but core WordPress development takes place on Subversion and Trac. When the API is merged into core, it will no longer be developed as a separate project. McCue proposes that the best of GitHub and Trac be integrated so developers comfortable with GitHub can continue to contribute to the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>Given the team’s experience with GitHub as well as Trac, we can bring the best of both worlds by helping integrate the two. This would also improve contributions to WordPress as a whole, and benefit the whole community. This will be especially important as we encourage more contributions from the wider community (client authors, for example). We think we can make good progress here, and we’d love to try to help improve the process.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although there&#8217;s a <a href="https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress">GitHub repository for WordPress</a> that&#8217;s synced to its Subversion counterpart, it does not accept pull requests. If integrating GitHub and Trac proves to be successful, it could open the door for WordPress to accept pull requests or contributions through GitHub.</p>
<p>The plan to merge the API into core is not finalized and the team needs your <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/">comments, questions, and opinions</a>. I encourage you to read the full proposal and the comments as McCue answers additional questions related to the merge. How happy are you to see this merge proposal?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 18:55:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>According to DeRosia, many Indians feel like their WordPress communities are not getting the respect they deserve. DeRosia believes the amount of excitement expressed by Indians for HeroPress is because their work is noticed and appreciated.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;That</em> is why India is excited about HeroPress. They’re getting respect. Not just from me, but from thousands of readers around the world,&#8221; DeRosia said.</p>
<p>Although DeRosia says he&#8217;d be content with the impacts the site has had if HeroPress ended today, I would be sad to see it go  because it&#8217;s a great addition to the WordPress community.

The Foundation wanted Yablon to stop using its trademarks, dismiss the opposition proceeding, pay the foundation for any profits related to use of the WordPress trademarks, pay up to $100,000 per infringing domain name, transfer the domains and pay other fees and damages.</p>
<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>
<p>On June 22nd, <a href="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&pty=OPP&eno=7">Yablon filed a request</a> for default judgement. On June 29th, the Foundation responded to Yablon by <a href="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&pty=OPP&eno=8">asking the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board</a> to deny Yablon&#8217;s request for default judgement.</p>
<p>On September 9th, David Mermelstein, Administrative Trademark Judge, <a href="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&pty=OPP&eno=9">filed a response</a> that not only denied Yablon&#8217;s motion for default judgment, but also suspended proceedings until the civil case was complete.</p>
<p>With proceedings suspended, Yablon could no longer file motions or requests with the TTAB. The only option left was to proceed through court.</p>
<h2>The Settlement Between Yablon and The Foundation</h2>
<p>On September 21st, Yablon and the WordPress Foundation <a href="https://cloudup.com/cLmq3DWS6MZ">settled out of court</a> (PDF).</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/YablonSettlementSample.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48277" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/YablonSettlementSample.png?resize=839%2C621" alt="Sample of Settlement" /></a>Sample of Settlement
<h3>Yablon&#8217;s Obligations</h3>
<p>According to the settlement, by no later than October 15th, Yablon agrees to cease any and all use of the WordPress name, logos, trademarks, and any other name or mark confusingly similar to the term WordPress or its logo.</p>
<p>He also has to cease any and all use of the WordPress Marks, standing alone or in combination with other words or designs, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use in any company name</li>
<li>Meta-tags</li>
<li>Domain names</li>
<li>Personalized URLs</li>
<li>Keyword Advertising on Yablon&#8217;s websites</li>
<li>Social media handles or account names</li>
<li>Indoor outdoor store signage</li>
<li>Letterhead</li>
<li>Stationary</li>
<li>Business cards</li>
</ul>
<p>Yablon must also comply with the terms of the <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/">WordPress trademark and domain name policies</a>.</p>
<p>No later than five days after the effective date (Oct 15th), Yablon has to transfer all of the domains he owns that incorporate the WordPress Mark to the Foundation.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Yablon acknowledges that the Foundation owns and has the exclusive rights in and to the WordPress marks in connection with the goods and services identified in each of WordPress&#8217; registrations.</p>
<p>Yablon can no longer do anything inconsistent with the Foundation&#8217;s ownership of its WordPress Marks and registrations thereof, including but not limited to, contesting the Foundation&#8217;s title to or the validity of the WordPress marks or the trademark registrations thereof.</p>
<h3>WordPress Foundation&#8217;s Obligations</h3>
<p>Once Yablon transfers the domains to the Foundation and does not breach the terms of the agreement, the Foundation will redirect the domains to a domain of Yablon&#8217;s choosing for 6 months from the effective date or April 1, 2016, whichever comes later.</p>
<p>Within 10 days of the domains being transferred, the Foundation will file a stipulated request to withdrawal its U.S. Opposition Proceeding No. 91221895 without prejudice and Case 3:15-cv02745 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, without prejudice.</p>
<p>As long as Yablon does not breach the agreement, the Foundation agrees not to sue for violating its trademarks prior to the effective date.</p>
<p>The Foundation will not object to Yablon&#8217;s use of the WordPress Marks as part of any subdomains or subdirectories associated with any second level domain name registered to and controlled exclusively by Yablon.</p>
<p>Examples include but are not limited to, wordpress.answerguy.com or answerguy.com/wordpress in connection with services that involve use of the WordPress platform, support the WordPress brand services, and that do not otherwise violate the rights of the Foundation.</p>
<h2>In Summary</h2>
<p>Both parties agree to bear their own attorney&#8217;s fees and costs, if any were incurred through the effective date.</p>
<p>When I <a href="http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-sues-jeff-yablon-for-trademark-infringement">spoke to Yablon</a> on the phone in June shortly after the lawsuit was filed, he sounded like he knew what he was getting into and the complexities involved with U.S. Trademarks. Yablon strongly believed he had enough evidence to pursue the matter and to see it through the court system.</p>
<p>Instead of seeing the court case all the way through, he chose to give up which in the court system, is not the same thing as losing, as losing or winning sets a precedent.</p>
<p>While Yablon didn&#8217;t lose the case, the WordPress Foundation didn&#8217;t win either. It&#8217;s a reminder that the Foundation will aggressively defend its trademarks in the court system if other means prove unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Do you think Yablon’s mission to defend his use of WordPress in a top-level domain name and potentially open the door for others to do the same, was in the best interest of the WordPress community as a whole?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 01:59:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p><a href="https://gravityflow.io/">Gravity Flow</a> is one of the coolest new plugins I&#8217;ve seen in quite some time.</p>
<p>Invoices, purchase orders, job applications, and employee vacation requests are just a few potential applications for Gravity Flow, which makes form-centric approval, user input, and notification processes simple.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Gravity Flow, you use the power of <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/">Gravity Forms</a> to design your forms, and you use Gravity Flow to design your process using easy to use drag-and-drop tools,&#8221; the video states. The flows created in Gravity Flow can be customized to include all sorts of user-defined paths to request stakeholder feedback, get administrative approval, or fire off a notification that a certain step in the flow has been accomplished. It can even be integrated with other notification systems like Zapier.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that common to see a WordPress plugin (especially an add-on plugin) that simultaneously targets a niche and serves it so extensively. Gravity Flow is built to extend the powerful Gravity Forms product, and it really takes it an extra mile.</p>
<p>I see a lot of potential for Gravity Flow for intranets and other corporate environments with lots of stakeholders and traditionally clunky, email based workflows for approval of common tasks.</p>
<h3>Trying Gravity Flow</h3>
<p>I took Gravity Flow for a spin, because there is a handy demo site capability built in. For a plugin this complex, being able to test drive it is a really great feature. Most workflow tasks can take place either in the admin or on the front-end.</p>
<p>Creating workflows feels a lot like adding regular notifications to Gravity Forms.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14340" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-workflow-752x579.png" alt="gravity-flow-workflow" width="752" height="579" /></p>
<p>Workflows have many configuration and sending options. And each step can be sorted and arranged to follow a series of steps, and can even allow for delays (like for a scholarship review period, in my example).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the view for an administrator, but someone who is responsible for providing feedback or approval has a front-end view to directly interact with the workflow.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14339" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-review-update-workflow-752x872.png" alt="gravity-flow-review-update-workflow" width="752" height="872" /></p>
<p>And administrators can see reports of activity for various workflows.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14338" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-reports-752x552.png" alt="gravity-flow-reports" width="752" height="552" /></p>
<p>This is a pretty simple overview of the plugin, and I&#8217;d recommend you <a href="http://demo.gravityflow.io/">check out the demo</a>, or his full <a href="http://docs.gravityflow.io/category/34-walkthroughs">walkthrough</a> examples. but this at least highlights some of the plugin&#8217;s power.</p>
<h3>Development of Gravity Flow</h3>
<p>One of the more interesting things about Gravity Flow is that <a href="https://www.stevenhenty.com/">Steven Henty</a> made it. Steven actually works at Rocketgenius, the company behind Gravity Forms, and he is a developer of the main Gravity Forms product.</p>
<p>I talked to Steven about why this isn&#8217;t a Gravity Forms official add-on, and what it&#8217;s like working on a side project for your own company&#8217;s product.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rocketgenius has a lot of plans and loads of really exciting stuff in the pipeline so it was a question of priorities &#8211; Rocketgenius can’t possibly do absolutely everything at the same time. For me it’s a project that’s niche enough to be an interesting and profitable side project and yet not too time-consuming so I can continue to focus 100% on my day job.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also reiterated how important it is to him that he had his team behind him for this project. And Carl Hancock &#8212; co-founder of Rocketgenius &#8212; is excited about Steven&#8217;s product as well, saying &#8220;The product is awesome. It&#8217;s definitely more complex [and] business oriented, but that&#8217;s a good thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carl also shared that Steve has a background that lends itself to thinking about complex problems to solve, working on, &#8220;more enterprise stuff pre-WordPress, on a wide variety of platforms and programming languages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Steve did a great job with Gravity Flow, and I&#8217;m happy to see it out there.  On <a href="https://www.stevenhenty.com/gravity-flow/">his personal blog</a>, he highlights use cases for the product, which are real world examples based on how his first 100 beta testers are using it.</p>
<h3>Gravity ecosystem</h3>
<p>A few Rocketgenius employees have Gravity Forms focused side projects, which I think is really cool. Another favorite of mine is David Smith&#8217;s <a href="http://gravitywiz.com/">Gravity Wiz</a>, that adds functionality snippets, or &#8220;perks&#8221;, to Gravity Forms. The third-party ecosystem is doing well too; <a href="https://gravityplus.pro/">Gravity Plus</a> and <a href="https://gravityview.co/">Gravity View</a> are two healthy Gravity Forms focused businesses that come to mind, and I&#8217;m sure there are many more.</p>
<p>The main plugin continues to dominate the WordPress forms space. Though it is commercial only, it powers hundreds of thousands of websites, and has dozens of official <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/">add-ons</a>. Carl has told me many times he doesn&#8217;t even view most other WordPress forms plugins as competition (though newer entrants like <a href="https://ninjaforms.com/">Ninja Forms</a> are doing quite well for themselves), as Gravity Forms aims to take marketshare away from complex hosted solutions like Wufoo, rather than gobble up the much larger but less demanding market that just wants simple contact forms.</p>

<p>Last July, the lead organizer of <a href="https://pune.wordcamp.org/2015/">WordCamp Pune, India </a>asked if I would come and speak about HeroPress. This post isn&#8217;t going to be about <a href="http://heropress.com/about/">HeroPress</a> nor about <a href="http://heropress.com/category/wordcamp/pune/">my adventures on the trip</a>. No, this post is going to be about a WordCamp in a relatively large city in India, how it compares to American WordCamps, and some things that were experimented with.</p>
<h2>The Similarities</h2>
<p>In many ways, WordCamp Pune is exactly like every other WordCamp I&#8217;ve been to. The night before the event, there was a speaker dinner with excellent food and wonderful company. Registration was chaotic because WiFi was a mess.</p>
<p>Everyone was happy and excited to be there, and it was very loud because everyone wanted to be part of a conversation. It had all the elements I love about WordCamps; handshakes between new friends, hugs between old friends, and huge transfers of information between everyone, it was fantastic. Aside from WordCamp Miami, it&#8217;s also the largest WordCamp I&#8217;ve attended with 500 tickets sold.</p>
<p>It was well-organized, by which I mean things were well planned for, and handled well when they didn&#8217;t work out. Sessions were held in university class rooms. I think they were a little small for the number of attendees, but it didn&#8217;t detract from the experience. Here&#8217;s an example of a room:</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48218" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png?resize=904%2C509" alt="WordCamp Pune Classrooms" /></a>Here&#8217;s Ramya Pandyan talking about being a better blogger:</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>
<h2>The Differences</h2>
<p>This is the first WordCamp I&#8217;ve attended where the sessions were in a variety of languages. I would expect this in a place like WordCamp EU, but to have it be a variety of <em>local</em> languages was fascinating to me.</p>
<p>The unofficial time zone of India is <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2010/04/28/india-journal-understanding-ist-indian-stretchable-time/">Indian Stretchable Time</a>. On the first day of WordCamp, Saurabh worked hard to keep things on schedule. We started 30 minutes late, but on Foundation Day, things got started an hour late.</p>
<p>The room was full of people sitting and waiting patiently, but starting on time was <strong>not expected</strong>. In the US, I would have expected a lot more cranky people.</p>
<p>Many things were heavily guarded. The main venue was quite open, but to get into Foundation Day, I had to let these guys check me with a magnetic wand:</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48219" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png?resize=904%2C510" alt="Indian Policemen" /></a>Then 20 feet away sign in at a guard house, and then 30 feet beyond that show my ID inside the front door of the venue. This kind of thing also happened at restaurants and every time I went into my hotel. No-one was ever aggressive or suspicious, it&#8217;s just something that happened and everyone took it in stride.</p>
<h2>The Word Lounge</h2>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-48220" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png?resize=298%2C462" alt="Word Lounge" /></a> There was a room set aside to be an all day open session for writers. There&#8217;s a local group called <a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetSambar">Alphabet Sambar</a> (Sambar is a soup) that has a regular meetup to help each other with writing. They made sure to welcome attendees and keep a good discussion going all day.</p>
<p>I love this idea of unconference rooms based on topic. Some people thrive on the group communication that can come from that format, and I&#8217;d love to see other topical open forums at other WordCamps.</p>
<h2>The After Party</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of quiet after parties, so I can talk to people. I can also appreciate people wanting a pretty intense party atmosphere. The <a href="https://twitter.com/crccpune">Classic Rock Coffee Co.</a> offered both.</p>
<p>It had three large areas, the largest being almost 6000 sq. ft., one about 800 sq. ft., and an ampitheater with seating for about 100 where they had live classic rock bands.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was a closed in area with seating for about 40 people that felt more like a cafe or restaurant. The larger open areas had a full bar and restaurant. Except for the cafe, the whole place had a fabric roof which is less sturdy than canvas. It had an outdoors feel.</p>
<p>I was sitting at a table of about 15 people and had no trouble communicating with any of them. I was probably 130 feet from the music and it was well contained. I was able to communicate without noise being an issue.</p>
<p>Groups of people sat at tables, in the cafe, in the ampitheater; wherever they were most comfortable. It was probably my favorite after-party venue of all time.</p>

<h2>Bits and Pieces</h2>
<p>The most difficult thing for me was trying to discern people through their accents. Just about everyone had a solid handle on English, but there&#8217;s a mental fatigue that comes from parsing the words through an accent. The longer you do it, the harder it gets, especially with sleep deprivation. I tried not to be rude, and people were patient with me.</p>
<p>There was a photo area with some crazy hats and people seemed to have a really good time with it. I can see it working at other WordCamps as well. The ladies from Hummingbird got one of me in a crazy hat, but I haven&#8217;t seen it yet.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-48226" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png?resize=1025%2C578" alt="Crazy Hat Picture" /></a></p>
<p>Lunch was prepared on-site in realtime and it worked. It was mostly sandwiches, and the food prep people took a request, made the sandwich, and handed it to the person in moments. I wouldn&#8217;t have expected it to work that smoothly, but it did.</p>
<p>Fruit and bottled water were available just about all the time, which was nice since it was pretty hot that day.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Except for the food and language, this WordCamp didn&#8217;t feel all that foreign to me. I suspect it&#8217;s because WordCamps have a solid template for sessions, scheduling, etc. I enjoyed that, it enabled me to really take part in the event without having to stand to the side wondering what was going on.</p>
<p>The organizers seemed to be on the ball and did a great job sharing the responsibilities, which I think is vital with a camp this size. The people were engaged, took full advantage of the options available to them, and <strong>that</strong> is what made it a successful WordCamp in my opinion.</p>
<p>If you ever get the chance to attend a WordCamp in a culture other than your own, I highly recommend you jump at the opportunity.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 12 Sep 2015 02:50:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Most of the work I do is on a Windows 7 Professional 64bit desktop PC with two 23-inch monitors. When I work remotely, I use a fully loaded 15-inch MacBook Pro with retina display from 2013. As a devoted Windows user, I feel like I&#8217;m part of a dying breed, especially within the WordPress ecosystem.</p>
<p>For WordPress Weekly, I use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samson-CO1U-Studio-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000PTF0E2">Samson CO1U</a> USB powered condenser microphone connected to a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/musical-instruments/dp/B001D7UYBO/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&ie=UTF8&qid=1442008126&sr=1-1&keywords=Rode+Swivel+mount">Rode PSA1 swivel mount</a> with a boom arm.</p>
<p>I predominantly work in a sitting position which is why I&#8217;m in the market for a standing desk where the height can be easily adjusted. I&#8217;m also looking for a new office chair where the arm rests don&#8217;t disintegrate within the first year of use.</p>

This year, 213 people participated which is 30 more <a href="https://bbpress.org/blog/2014/05/2014-bbpress-survey-results/">than last year</a>. After reviewing, replacing, and removing some questions from the 2014 survey, this year&#8217;s survey has 25 questions.</p>
<p>A variety of survey question types were used to gather the data including, multiple choices, check boxes, text fields, email box, and open‐ended questions. Empty forms were deleted and those marked as incomplete were reviewed individually. Submissions that had no responses on the second and third pages of the survey were excluded from the report.</p>
<h2>Highlights From the Survey</h2>
<p>The majority of respondents use bbPress 2.5 and above with WordPress 4.2 and above. Seventy-one percent of participants using bbPress &lt;=1.x.x are also using the latest version of WordPress. This data indicates bbPress users are vigilant in keeping their sites up to date.</p>
<p>In terms of who uses bbPress, 51% of respondents use it on their own sites while 30% create sites with bbPress forums for others.</p>

<p>For the second year in a row, the top three languages used are English 74%, German 7%, and French 6.5%. Three-fourths or 75% of bbPress installations are within WordPress either in the domain root, physical directory, or physical subdomain.</p>
<p>The remaining 25% are on multisite installations where more than half have activated bbPress network-wide and the rest in multiple networks.</p>

<p>One statistic I&#8217;m proud of is that 29% of the respondents found out about the survey through WP Tavern.</p>

A preference for Responsive, mobile-first themes is in fourth place at 39%.</p>
<p>For the second year in a row, Attachments (42.5%), Ajaxification of Topics and Replies (41.5%), and Moderation tools in the front end (39%) are the most requested features.</p>

<h2>The Future of bbPress</h2>
<p>Mercime, a BuddyPress and bbPress core contributor, confirmed at the end of the survey that the bbPress project is alive and well. According to Mercime, the development team is in the middle of a large migration project:</p>
<blockquote><p>The <a href="https://bbpress.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/src/humans.txt">bbPress core team</a> has been involved in the process of migrating the WordPress Support Forums (English and all Rosetta sites) from bbPress 1.x.x to bbPress 2.5.8 starting with one European-language forums subsite which has been already ported and being tested on.</p>
<p>While this migration has been discussed many times and often over the years, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/">@johnjamesjacoby</a> formally started the process when he <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/05/15/wp-org-forums-plugins-audit/">posted the results of an audit</a> to show the custom functionality required for a successful migration.</p></blockquote>
<p>The project involves multiple teams including, the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/support/">WP Support team</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/">WP Meta Team</a>. The migration will impact more than 8 million users on WordPress.org. Any improvements made to bbPress to ease the migration process are going to be merged back into the project.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 20:54:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Amit Kvint, compatibility team leader for WPML, confirmed the emails are not a result of a security breach.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://wpml.org/2015/09/password-update-email-from-wpml/">post on the official WPML blog</a>, Kvint says the emails were a preventive measure to insure accounts remain secure, &#8220;The main purpose and underlying principle for this action was making sure everyone has a good new strong password, we consider this an important step in online security,&#8221; Kvint said.</p>
<p>Kvint acknowledges the improvements in WordPress 4.3 in how passwords are handled and admits that sending passwords in plaintext was not a good idea, &#8220;The best practice would be, once the password is sent, to login and reset the password to a new strong one. We will definitely revise the way this is done in the future,&#8221; Kvint said.</p>
<p>The blog post does not go into detail in how they determined passwords to be weak. To the best of my knowledge, WPML does not have a policy in place to enforce strong passwords. While no accounts were compromised, if some of the contacted customers choose a weak password, wouldn&#8217;t it defeat the purpose of resetting passwords in the first place?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 07:28:52 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>The new interface separates some of Jetpack&#8217;s functionality into categories such as, performance and security, traffic growth, and WordPress.com tools. The most commonly used modules are listed first with a link underneath that takes users to the other 27 modules and the old settings page.</p>

<p>Turning a module on or off is accomplished by clicking a toggle. Services you need to pay for are clearly marked with links to learn more.</p>
<p>One of the biggest drawbacks to Jetpack is switching between a local server or staging environment. If you move your site from one URL to another, Jetpack automatically detects the change and prompts the user to confirm if the URL is correct.</p>

<p>If Jetpack thinks two URLs are separate websites, it recommends that you create a new connection to prevent a service interruption on the original domain. The prompt has links to reset the connection, confirm that the URL is part of a development environment, or submit a trouble ticket.</p>

<p>The VideoPress player in Jetpack 3.7 works on mobile devices thanks to its responsive redesign. Having VideoPress enabled allows you to easily embed VideoPress powered videos to your site by copying and pasting the video&#8217;s URL into the visual editor.</p>
<p>Here are a few other changes included in 3.7:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to enable per-post opt-out for Subscriptions by <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/subscriptions/#filters">adding a filter</a> to a functionality plugin.</li>
<li>A new Widget Visibility rule that allows you to show or hide widgets based on a page’s parent.</li>
<li>Sharing buttons now display on bbPress forum posts</li>
